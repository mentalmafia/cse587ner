This is a GitHub repository containing my submission of Named Entity Recognition for the Midterm project

To execute the code:
1. Download the Midterm_project.ipynb file
2. Upload it to your Google Drive and run it as it is on Google Colab.
3. You may also run it using Jupyter Notebook locally. However, ensure all the necessary Python packages being imported are installed prior to running the file.
